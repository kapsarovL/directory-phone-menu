# Directory Phone Menu

This project was create with [ React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Components
The entire application is written within a single functional component named App. This component manages the state, behavior, and rendering of the entire application.

## State Management
**State Variables:**
 Three state variables are used: `name`, `phone`, and `directory`.

**`name`** and **`phone`** are used to store the current input values.

**`directory`** is an array used to store the list of phone directory  records.

## Behavior
**Loading Records:** Upon initial render, previously entered records are loaded from the browser's local storage.

**Adding Records:** A function addRecord is defined to handle adding new records to the directory, updating both the local state and local storage.

**Deleting Records:** A function deleteRecord is defined to handle deleting a record from the directory by its index, updating both the local state and local storage.

## Rendering
**Form for Entering Records:** The component renders two input fields for entering a name and phone number, along with a button to save the record.

**Displaying Directory:** The component also renders a list of all the directory records, each with a delete button.

## Styling
The application includes simple CSS styling to arrange the elements, provided in an external **App.css** file.

**Open-Props** Open source CSS variables custom properties to help accelerate adaptive and consistent design.

## Storage
**Local Storage:** The application utilizes the web browser's local storage to persist the records across browser sessions.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
